* the rest CoAP server couldn't get message correctly although it has no autorestart problem now
* joystick example still have bugs, always show two buttons result when I press it, maybe this is the difference between the official joystick
* temperory could not run neither coap3 or coap7, I think it's the hardware reason, But I will try it.
* the tcp-ipv6 example couldn't not work between nodes and nodes, but works fine with nodes and pc with netcat. So the psocket example.
